                            &quot;Web Developer&quot; just means I develop software for the web, plain
                            and simple. It could be a website, a widget, a plugin, or a game: if it
                            opens in a browser I probably have something to say about it.
                            <br /><br />
                            &quot;UI&quot; stands for User Interface, and &quot;UX&quot; stands for User Experience.
                            These are just high-falutin&apos; terms for how a site looks, and
                            how easy it is to use.
                            If a site is ugly, cluttered, or unintuitive to use, somewhere there is
                            (hopefully) someone like me working hard on a branch full of bug fixes.
                    </div>
                    <div class="work">
                        <h1>What I do:</h1>
                        <p>
                            Specifically, I work with the visual side of the web, the part that users
                            interact with. You know, the fun part.
                            <br /><br />
                            The products I create range from standalone sites to web
                            games, with a heavy focus on cross-browser compatibility and user
                            experience. My philosophy is to keep things simple, clean, and fast,
                            because that&apos;s what people have come to expect from the web; things
                            should just work, period. This means responsive layouts, as few dependencies
                            as possible, and flexible, well-documented code.
                            <br /><br />

                    <div class="play">
                        <h1>Try not to judge me</h1>
                        <p>
                            What do I do when I&apos;m not getting paid to sit and stare at a screen
                            with crazy stuff all over it? Why, I sit and stare at a different screen
                            with even crazier stuff all over it.
                            <br /><br />
                            For instance, I&apos;ve watched so many movies and TV shows that it&apos;s
                            a miracle my retinas are still attached. I can quote more lines from
                            John Carpenter films than John Carpenter probably can, and I&apos;m
                            pretty sure that I can beat any mortal at Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon (though
                            Mr. Bacon has yet to accept my challenge).
                            <br /><br />
                            I also play
                            <a href="http://www.xboxgamertag.com/search/FeldmansCareer/" target="_blank">
                                an unholy amount of video games
                            </a> and have chalked up a rather impressive Xbox gamerscore
                            (over 40,000 - tell your friends). I&apos;ve been playing games since I was
                            old enough to use a DOS prompt, and I don&apos;t plan on stopping any time
                            soon.
                            <br /><br />
                            And, just to complete the geek-trifecta, I am also a pretty big fan of
                            <a href="http://www.comixology.com/" target="_blank">comics</a> in
                            general. I don&apos;t keep up with many weeklies but I'm a huge fan of
                            <i>Transmetropolitan</i>, <i>Fables</i>, and <i>Powers</i>, just to name a few.
